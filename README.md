DAOrayaki uses Hackerlink's bounty to publish tasks. For specific operations, see Hackerlink's operating documents:
- [Bounty Publishing Guide](https://hackerlink.io/blog/bountyfa-bu-zhi-nan/)
- [Bounty Claim Guide](https://hackerlink.io/blog/hackerlink-bountyren-ling-zhi-nan/)

1. Your github account needs to be bound to the hackerlink account.
2. You have already claimed the task in the bounty page of hackerlink.
3. In the comment of the pull request you submitted, you need to indicate the corresponding issue number. For example, if you submit a result for an issue with Issue ID "7", the comment of the pull request must be (#7).
4. Only submit the results of one issue at one time. If multiple tasks are completed, please submit them in multiple times.
5. Bounty solvers needs to hunt the bounties within DAOrayaki discord community (link: https://discord.gg/DVkXYZhQ7j) under the #daorayaki-bounties channel. First in First Served (all bounty solvers need to follow a chronological order pattern to reclaim the bounty if it is not solved on time from the predecessor solver).   
6. A Bounty solver needs to submit their acquisition of the specific bounty within the github issues tab by simply putting a comment to the bounty issue declaring solver's order for solving the bounty and solver's discord username (#1 <discord_username>, #2 <discord_username>, #3 <discord_username>, and so on) the submission needs to be after the step number 5 above.
7. After the bounty task is completed, the "hunter" also needs to update the corresponding task results in Github, please check the specific format requirements in this file.
