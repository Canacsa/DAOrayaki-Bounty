# DAOrayaki-Bounty

Bounty认领流程：

## 认领前
1. 您的github账号需要已经与hackerlink账号绑定, 并且hackerlink账号与您的区块链钱包绑定。(注：目前通过polygon发放赏金)
2. 您在hacklink的bounty页面中点击Participate按钮参与任务。(注：首次认领任务时需要绑定地址。)

## 认领过程
1. 认领任务在discord中完成，赏金“猎人”们需要在DAOrayaki的Discord社区中（https://discord.gg/vdxgGhrSy4） 的#daorayaki-bounties频道中点击赏金（Bounty）任务。所有Bounty任务先到先得，当Bounty任务没有在规定的时间内被解决的情况下，所有“猎人”们按照认领任务的顺序自动替补。  
2. 在完成Discord认领任务之后，“猎人”需要在相应的GitHub Issue下添加评论以表明自己获得的先后顺序，该评论需要包括自己的序号和Discord用户名，例如#1 <discord_username>, #2 <discord_username>, #3 <discord_username>，依此类推。  

## 提交成果
1. 成果通过修改任务记录文件的方式提交，修改该文件需要提交pull request。 赏金任务完成后，“猎人”需要在Github更新相应的任务成果，具体格式要求请在该文件中查看。文件地址：[DAOrayaki Bounty : Interstellar Immigrant 2022-1-23](https://github.com/DAOrayaki/DAOrayaki-Bounty/blob/main/DAOrayaki%20Bounty%20:%20Interstellar%20Immigrant%202022-1-23)。同时，“ 猎人”还需要在DAOrayaki的Discord社区中的#daorayaki-bounties频道中分享Github任务提交截图。
2. 您提交的pull request的评论中，需要注明对应的issue编号，如您对Issue Id 为7的问题提交成果，该条pull request的评论需要为（ #7 ）
3.  一次只提交一个问题的成果，如果有多个任务完成，请分多次提交。
